LenMus Phonascus, "the teacher of music", is a free program to help you
in the study of music theory and for training your ear.

LenMus is an open project, committed to the principles of
open source, free education, and open access to information.

It has no commercial
purpose. It is an open workbench for working on all areas related to teaching
music, and music representation and management with computers. It aims at
developing publicly available knowledge, methods and algorithms related to all
these areas and, at the same time, to provide free quality software for music
students, amateurs, and teachers.
